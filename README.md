# Choices & Voices v2.1

Choices & Voices is an online scenario application developed by the Delaware Valley Regional Planning Commission. 

This project contains information related to the development of Choices & Voices, and a companion Excel-based application to the source code.

The Excel version of the Choices & Voices App resides within the 'Questions', 'Table', and 'Analysis' tabs.

Additional tabs show how background data was developed.
- Regional Transit Score builds off DVRPC's Transit Score methodology, and is used to tie scenario planning travel demand model results to land use.
- Residential Energy calculates energy use, its associated costs, and greenhouse gas emissions per household for the baseline.
- Veh Ownership computes the ownership costs of each vehicle in Greater Philadelphia, and uses Regional Transit Score to estimate per capita vehicle ownership rates.
- Per Capita Travel ties Regional Transit Score to Travel Demand.
- Inf Cond ties investment levels to vehicle operating costs, vehicle hours of delay (due to pavement conditions), and change in travel demand (due to pavement conditions)
- Delay ties peak period travel demand to speed (and then delay, using TTI methodology), and identifies the relationship between Roadway Operational Improvement investments and delay reduction.
- Elasticity shows DVRPC assumptions with how structural pricing changes would affect travel demand.


Choices & Voices is built off analysis and modeling completed by DVRPC in a number of different scenario planning efforts.
