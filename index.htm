Choices &amp; Voices allows you to develop your own vision for the future of Greater Philadelphia by determining your preferred future building pattern, developing an investment budget, and investigating which transportation projects you would like to see happen over the next 27 years.  You can then see the impact your choices have on a number of factors.
			</p>
			<p><a href="#" data-bind="click: function() { $('#instructions').modal('show'); }">Click here for instructions</a> on how to use Choices &amp; Voices. Once you have finished your scenario, you will have the option to submit it to DVRPC and add your voice to the conversation.

    <div class="modal-body">
	<p>On the upper-right corner of the screen is a map of the nine-county Greater Philadelphia region. This map will reflect how your choices would influence development patterns in the region. New development will be shown in dark brown. The more dark brown you see, the more acres your scenario develops.
	</p>
	<p>Below this map, is a series of indicators that display information related to our current development and transportation patterns. These regional measures will change depending on the choices you make in your scenario. Green arrows and percent changes indicate a positive outcome for the region, while red arrows and percent changes indicate a negative outcome. Use these indicators to guide your decision making and help you to better understand how the decisions we collectively make today will impact our future. For more information about each indicator, hover over them with your mouse. You can quickly compare your scenario to current indicator values, by sliding the arrow under "Your Vision for the Future" back from 2040 to today.
	</p>
	<p>The questions you are asked are either multiple choice, or use a slider bar to allow you to identify the amount of funding you would like to see for the type of project. You can use the green tabs across the top of the screen to go back and change your answer to any question. All project cost dollar amounts are in year-of-expenditure dollars, meaning that the impact of inflation between the present day and the year that the project is constructed is taken into account.
	</p>
	<p>When you are finished, you can click on the "Submit" button to send your scenario to DVRPC. Once submitted it will become part of the "Average User Scenario" shown in the results page for each indicator.
	</p>
	<p>Indicator values are based on regional trends, forecasts, and modeling. These results are not absolute, and many other factors, such as school quality, housing affordability, taxes, crime, technology, climate change, energy costs, and the economy, will ultimately impact location decisions. This exercise is intended to illustrate the impacts of development and transportation investments so that we are able to better consider and prepare for the future.

			<h2>Transportation Funding</h2>
			<p>The passage of Act 89 has provided a significant increase in funding for transportation investments in Pennsylvania. However, the region still faces a considerable shortfall between the cost to maintain and improve our roads, bridges, and transit system and the anticipated revenue the region will receive over the life of the <i>Connections 2040</i> Plan. The Plan is required to maintain a balanced budget, and cannot spend any more than can be reasonably anticipated.
			</p>
			<p>Given our funding gap, and the fact that the Greater Philadelphia region pays a lower local share for transportation infrastructure than many of our competing regions, the <i>Connections 2040</i> Plan considers ways to increase funding to help improve our transportation system, in order to enhance quality of life and maintain economic competitiveness.

			<li><label class="checkbox" data-content="This tax is the current primary source of funding for both state and federal governments. The federal tax rate is 18.4 cents per gallon for gasoline and 24.4 cents per gallon for diesel fuel. Act 89 of 2013 raised the Pennsylvania state tax to 40.7 cents per gallon for gasoline and 51.0 cents per gallon for diesel starting January 1, 2014. This was done by uncapping the $1.25 maximum rate at which the wholesale fuel cost of gasoline is taxed. The cap will be lifted two more times, in 2015 and 2017, resulting in state tax rates of 65 cents per gallon for gasoline and 81.5 cents per gallon for diesel. These rates will be adjusted annually, beginning on January 1, 2019 based on the wholesale fuel prices. In New Jersey, the tax is 14.5 cents per gallon for gasoline and 17.5 cents per gallon for diesel. Since these rates are per gallon, the amount of tax revenue collected does not increase with rising gasoline prices. An option is to charge a sales tax on gasoline purchases.

	<p>These costs do not account for the effect of inflation. An item that costs $1 today will likely cost between $2.00 and $2.50 in 2040. Growing world population and economic development may also mean the cost of energy will increase at an even greater rate.

Your scenario helps to lower emissions by focusing on road pricing strategies that reduce the demand for vehicle travel and energy use. Achieving this goal will require more compact development patterns that help to reduce the demand for vehicle travel and energy.

Reducing VMT means the region will be less energy-dependent and may be more economically competitive than other more spread-out regions.
	</p>
	<p data-bind="visible: viewModel.VMT.raw() > 7340 && viewModel.VMT.raw() <= 7540">Vehicle miles traveled have remained fairly constant in your scenario, but increases in population and jobs mean that total VMT in the region has increased.

	</p>
	<p data-bind="visible: viewModel.VMT.raw() > 7540">The annual number of miles driven by the average person has increased in your scenario because commutes are longer and most people must use an automobile for nearly every trip. Transportation costs have increased due to longer commutes and an increasing amount of time stuck in traffic congestion. The increase in VMT per person is far greater than the current capability of the region to provide the additional road capacity needed to keep congestion at manageable levels.

Substantial preservation needs remain outstanding, however all rail, trolley, and subway lines are able to continue to operate. Relatively poor conditions mean the region's transit system may have a hard time attracting riders who have other transportation options.

Often overlooked is the effect of exposure, the more one drives the more risk one takes in being involved in a traffic accident, fatal or not. <i>Choices &amp; Voices</i> assumes we reach the FHWA goal and then considers the impact of more or less driving on road fatalities per 100,000 capita.
